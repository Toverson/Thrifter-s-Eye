Terms of Service

Last Updated: July 27, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Thrifter's Eye mobile application (the "Service") operated by Thrifter's Eye ("us," "we," or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

1. The Service

Thrifter's Eye provides users with AI-powered analysis to identify objects and provide an estimated resale value based on publicly available data from online marketplaces. You acknowledge that this analysis is an estimate for informational purposes only and is not a guaranteed appraisal or valuation. Market conditions, item condition, and other factors can affect the actual value.

2. User Accounts

Upon first use, an anonymous account is created to save your scan history and manage subscriptions. You have the option to link this anonymous account to an email address or Google account to create a permanent account, which allows for data portability across devices. You are responsible for safeguarding any credentials used to access the Service.

3. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

The Service offers a "Pro" subscription which provides unlimited use of the core features.

Billing: Subscriptions are managed and billed through Apple's App Store. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.

Renewal: Your subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Cancellation: You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your device's Account Settings after purchase. We cannot cancel subscriptions on your behalf.

Restore Purchases: If you reinstall the app or get a new device, you may use the "Restore Purchases" feature to restore your active subscription entitlement.

4. User Conduct

You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to engage in any activity that would disrupt or harm the Service. This includes, but is not limited to, reverse-engineering the app or using automated means to access the Service.

5. Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Thrifter's Eye.

6. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that the AI-generated valuations will be accurate.

7. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Thrifter's Eye, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of the Service.

8. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
