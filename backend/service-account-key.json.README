# IMPORTANT: You need to download your actual service account key file from:
# Google Cloud Console > IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
#
# 1. Create or select a service account
# 2. Create a new JSON key
# 3. Download the JSON file  
# 4. Place it in this directory: /app/backend/[your-service-account-key].json
# 5. Update your backend code to reference the correct filename
#
# The original filename was: gen-lang-client-0045692674-0e08eb99ab10.json
# You should use a similar filename for your service account key.
#
# DO NOT commit the actual service account key JSON file to Git!
