# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Test scan successful: 'Vintage 1970s Swiss Made Watch' ($75-$295 CAD, 70% confidence). Country/currency parameters working correctly. search_marketplaces() function signature fix confirmed working. ✅ GET /api/history: Successfully retrieved 27 scans from database. ✅ GET /api/scan/{id}: Individual scan retrieval working perfectly. Minor note: Some historical 500 errors in logs but current functionality is stable. Backend is ready for frontend authentication debugging focus."

    message: "🎯 SCAN HISTORY ISSUE ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The problem is a complete mismatch between backend and frontend data storage systems. Backend uses MongoDB with hardcoded user_id 'prototype_user_01' and stores scans via POST /api/scan. Frontend uses Firestore with Firebase Auth user IDs and stores scans via ScanService.saveScan(). These are completely separate databases! Backend has 50 scans with user_id 'prototype_user_01', but frontend queries Firestore for Firebase Auth user IDs. The systems never interact. Frontend shows 'No scans yet' because it's looking in the wrong database. This explains why user confirmed scans are 'saved correctly' (backend MongoDB) but frontend can't retrieve them (queries Firestore). SOLUTION: Either integrate frontend with backend API endpoints OR modify backend to use Firestore with Firebase Auth user IDs."
