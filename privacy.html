This Privacy Policy describes how Thrifter's Eye ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile application, Thrifter's Eye (the "Service").

1. Information We Collect

To provide and improve our Service, we collect the following types of information:

Anonymous User ID: When you first use our Service, we use Firebase Authentication to generate a unique, anonymous identifier for you. This allows us to save your data without requiring you to create a traditional account.

Scan Data: We collect the images you take of objects through the app and the analysis data generated by our AI. This is essential for the core functionality of the Service.

Subscription Status: We use RevenueCat to manage your subscription status (Free or Pro) which is linked to your anonymous user ID and your Apple ID.

Usage and Device Information: We may collect basic information about your device type, operating system version, and how you interact with our Service to diagnose issues and improve functionality (e.g., via Firebase Crashlytics).

Location Information: If you grant permission, we may collect your country-level location to provide a more relevant market analysis. If permission is denied, a default location (USA) is assumed.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To provide, maintain, and improve the core functionality of the Service.

To save and retrieve your personal scan history.

To process and manage your "Pro" subscription.

To restore your purchases and scan history on a new device.

To analyze usage trends and fix bugs or crashes.

To communicate with you, if you have provided a contact method.

3. Third-Party Services

Our Service depends on the following third-party services, which may also collect information:

Google (Firebase & Google Cloud): We use Firebase for authentication (including anonymous auth), database storage (Firestore), and crash reporting. We use Google Cloud Platform APIs (Vision AI, Custom Search, Gemini) to power our AI analysis feature. You can view Google's Privacy Policy here.

RevenueCat: We use RevenueCat to manage and verify in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat links your anonymous user ID to your purchase status. You can view RevenueCat's Privacy Policy here.

Apple: All in-app purchases are processed by Apple through their App Store. We do not receive or store your credit card information. Your transactions are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy.

4. Data Security

We are committed to protecting your data. We use secure cloud services (Google Firebase) to store your information and take reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure.

5. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
